# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains course materials for CS 415/515 Social Media Data Science Pipelines, taught by Kai-Cheng Yang. The repository is currently in its initial state with basic documentation and licensing.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a minimal structure:
- `README.md`: Course information and basic details
- `LICENSE`: MIT license for the course materials
- Repository is maintained under the YangKCLab organization

## Development Context

This is an educational repository for a social media data science course. As course content is developed, it will likely include:
- Data science pipelines and workflows
- Social media data processing examples
- Course assignments and materials
- Student project templates

Since this is a new repository, no specific build, test, or development commands are currently defined. Future development should consider the educational nature of the content and maintain clear, documented examples for students.
