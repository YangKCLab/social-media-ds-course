    \item All paper reading assignments will be made available via Brightspace.
\end{itemize}


\section{Assignments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Paper readings. The best way to start understanding what you can do with data science is
    to explore the state-of-the art. The best way to do that is to read research papers and that
    is what we will do in this class. There will be regular paper readings. For each paper,
    there will potentially be an in-class quiz.
    It is expected that all students come prepared (i.e., read the paper) and participate in the
    discussion to the best of their abilities.
    \item There will be three projects. Each project has three parts: a proposal, an implementation, and a report.
    Projects are to be completed in groups of 2-3 students.
\end{itemize}

Important notes about assignments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Late assignments may sometimes be accepted with penalty, which will typically be 5\%
    per day late (including weekends and holidays). We will not accept assignments more
    than 5 days after the due date unless there is a very compelling reason.
    \item For project submissions, please ensure your programs are clear, well-structured, and easy to evaluate.
    All programming assignments should have:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An adequate explanation of the design of your program.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You should be prepared to answer good-faith, technical questions asked about
            your design and implementation during 1:1 sessions with the instructor.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Documented code:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ideally, you use whatever documentation tools are available in the language you
            decide to implement in, but at minimum, all modules, classes, and functions
            should have a documentation header that explains what the code does.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Grading disputes, regrading and missing grades.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Should you dispute any grading, please be aware that we will not re-grade any
single issue you have. Instead, your work will be re-evaluated from scratch. The
new grade may be higher, lower, or stay the same. This new grade will not be
changed.
        \item No regrading can be requested two weeks after the date when graded work is
        returned to students.
        \item The scores of your assignments will be made available to you after the
assignments are graded.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Method of Assessment}%{{{

The following percentage weights will be used to assess student work:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Paper reading quizzes are worth 15\%.
    \item Three programming assignments (projects) 85\% split evenly across all three projects.
    % \item Any group containing graduate student groups will have additional requirements for each project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Grading Determination}\label{sec:grading_tentative_}%{{{

Your final grade for this course is largely based on your performance relative to the performance
of other students in the class. In other words, if your work is consistently better than average, you
are likely to receive an A.
The specific break down of grades is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A: 100--90
    \item B: 89--80
    \item C: 79--70
    \item D: 69--60
    \item F: 59--0
\end{itemize}

\section{Academic Honesty Expectations and Violation Penalty}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cheating on quizzes of any kind, including, but not limited to, the use of electronic devices, ``cheat sheets,'' or looking at another student's quiz are considered instances of cheating and will be reported as Category 1 academic dishonesty violation. You will also receive a one letter grade deduction (e.g., from A to B). More than one incident of cheating of any kind will result in an F for the entire course.
    \item The School of Computing at Binghamton wrote a letter to all computer science students about the importance of academic honesty. The letter is available at \url{https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/about/academic-honesty.html}.
    \item Please review the academic honesty document and make sure that you understand it!
    \item Each assignment must include the following statement:
    \begin{quote}
        ``We have done this assignment completely on our own. We have not copied it, nor have we given my solution to anyone else. We understand that if we are involved in plagiarism or cheating we will have to sign an official form that we have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. We also understand that we will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment and our grade will be reduced by at least one level (e.g., from A to B) for my/our offense, and that we will receive a grade of ``F'' for the course for any additional offense of any kind.''
    \end{quote}
    \item For this course, programming assignments (projects) are all team projects. Certain open-source tools/software are permitted to be used (see the description of each project for details). Used open-source tools/software must be clearly acknowledged in the submitted project report.
    \item Additionally, each project submission must include a statement of contribution, which describes which group members did what part of the assignment.
    \item The use of generative AI tools is allowed for this course given that students follow the guidelines detailed below.
    Violation of the guidelines and inappropriate use of generative AI tools will be considered cheating and will be reported as Category 1 academic dishonesty violation.
    More than one incident of cheating of any kind will result in an F for the entire course.
    % \item Your assignments will not be graded unless the statement above is present and is followed by your signature.
\end{itemize}


\section{Generative AI policy}

Since this is not a generative AI course, we take a moderate stance on the use of generative AI tools: they are allowed but not encouraged.
Students are encouraged to complete coursework independently to maximize learning outcomes.
However, we recognize the potential benefits of generative AI tools in the learning process.
Below are guidelines for students who choose to use these tools.

Generative AI tools include but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
    \item Coding assistants, such as Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code.
\end{itemize}

Students are allowed to use generative AI tools to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance their understanding of course material, such as gathering information and explaining concepts.
    \item Clarify ideas and polish their writing.
    \item Assist with project implementation.
\end{itemize}

Students should be aware that generative AI outputs can be erroneous, and they are fully responsible for verifying accuracy.
Additionally, AI outputs may not meet assignment requirements.
Since students are ultimately accountable for their submitted work, the quality will be reflected in their grade.

Students who choose to use generative AI tools must include an AI usage statement in their submitted assignments.
The statement should include the following information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The generative AI tool used.
    \item The prompt used to generate the output.
    \item How the AI-generated content was integrated into the assignment.
\end{itemize}

The following are not allowed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using generative AI tools to generate entire assignments without modification. Submitted work should reflect the student's own understanding, ideas, and effort.
    \item Any use of generative AI tools without properly acknowledging it in the AI usage statement.
\end{itemize}


\section{Managing Stress}

If you are having any issues with personal or academic stress at any time during the semester, I encourage you to seek support.
I do care about your wellbeing, and if my class becomes a pain point for you, you should feel free to reach out; I'm available to talk.
Additionally, a wide range of campus resources are available to provide help, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dean of Students Office: 607-777-2804
    \item University Counseling Center: 607-777-2772
    \item Interpersonal Violence Prevention: 607-777-3062
    \item Office of International Student \& Scholar Services: 607-777-2510
\end{itemize}

\section{Class Attendance Requirement}

Attendance is required and attendance will be checked regularly.
If you are not present when attendance was checked it will be counted as missing the class.
Showing up late is considered missing the class.

\section{Communication}

Students must use their Binghamton email address for all course communication.
Emails from non-binghamton.edu domains will not receive a response.

All emails must include ``[CS415]'' or ``[CS515]'' in the subject line for proper identification.
Emails without this subject line identifier may be ignored.

I will make every effort to respond to student emails within two business days.
Please plan accordingly—emails sent shortly before deadlines may not receive timely responses.
